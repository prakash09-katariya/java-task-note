Good morning Sir/Madam,

My name is Prakash Katariya, and I am from Surat.

I have completed my BBA graduation from VNSGU University in 2015.

I am a fresher web designer. I have worked on responsive websites using frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
I also use Figma to design website layouts.

I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I use them to create user-friendly and mobile-friendly websites.
I have experience in making projects live offline and on GitHub.
I also understand how to use Git and push code to GitHub repositories.

My short-term goal is to get a job in a good and reputed company.
My long-term goal is to grow in my career and become a team leader in the future.

My strengths are:
â€“ I am a quick learner
â€“ I am self-disciplined
â€“ I am self-motivated

My weakness is that sometimes I feel nervous while speaking, but I am improving it by practicing in front of a mirror.
